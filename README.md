# Webcomic Keyboard Navigator

A Firefox browser extension for using arrow keys to go back and forth when reading a webcomic.

[Add to Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webcomic-keyboard-navigator/)

## Usage

Right-click a "forward" or "back" button on a webcomic page to register it with the extension. You can then use the right or left arrow keys, respectively, to navigate the comic, instead of clicking on that button! The extension saves your settings automatically, so you don't have to register those buttons more than once.
